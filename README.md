# 🚀 Laravel REST API + JavaScript SPA Dashboard

A modern SPA-style authentication and user management system built using **Laravel REST APIs** and **Vanilla JavaScript** with secure **Sanctum Cookie-Based Authentication**.

This project follows a clean backend architecture using **Services**, **Form Requests**, **Events**, **Listeners**, and **Queues** while the frontend is rendered dynamically using JavaScript without any frontend framework.

# ⚡ SPA Frontend Architecture

This project uses a **Single Page Application (SPA)-style** frontend architecture without React or Vue.

Laravel serves a single Blade view while all frontend rendering and route handling are managed dynamically using JavaScript.

```php
Route::view('/{any}', 'layouts.app')->where('any', '.*');
```

Dynamic pages are rendered directly from JavaScript functions.

```javascript
function changePassword() {
    return `
        <section>
            ...
        </section>
    `;
}
```
